# ML-problem-solution-md-templates
Markdown Templates to build a task-targeted knowledge base in ML / Data Science  / Coding 

## Goal 
These trmplates are to function as a practical problem-solution lookup with solutions including 
- use case 
- assumptions
- example 
- code example
- references (internal) 
- library refs  

## Organization and Note Types (goal of quick usefull reference) 

**Provided templates**
- problem type
- problem
- solution 
- object

**General workflow:** 
- find problem type you are struggling with in the ::ptype 
- find specifc problem 
- linked are solution notes with ways to solve the above problem (concept, implementation, references)
- also available are short notes on objects / definitions used to understand the solution, 

**Associated Note Types:** 
- ::ptype indicated with #UU for general problem type (example "UU--overfitting")
- ::Problem (indicated by #U ) for more specific problem ("regularization via...)
- ::solution (to #U) ("L1 regularization for overfitting")
- ::object ("penalty term")

**If you have a Job / Training focus**
while completeness is tempting, we have wikipedia etc, 

1. Taylor the problem types to what you exoect to encounter at your job
2. focus on what might take you too much time to hunt for solutions in reak time. 
3. be sure examples are well annotated 
4. include references to relevant functions in associated libraries
5. Flow: problem type -> problem -> solution with assumptions -> examples

I hope these are helpful
