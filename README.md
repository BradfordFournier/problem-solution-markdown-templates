# ML-problem-solution-md-templates
Markdown Templates for a task-targeted personal knowledge database in markdown.   

## Goal 
These templates are to function as a practical problem-solution lookup with each solution including 
- use case 
- assumptions
- example 
- code example
- references (internal) 
- library refs  

## Organization and Note Types (goal of quick useful reference) 

**Provided templates**
- problem type
- problem
- solution 
- object

**General workflow:** 
- find problem type you are struggling within the ::ptyp (problemtype note)
- find specifc problem note
- linked are "solution notes" with ways to solve the relevant problem (concept, implementation, references)

**Associated Note Types:** 
- ::ptype indicated with #UU for general problem type (example "UU--overfitting")
- ::Problem (indicated by #U ) for more specific problem ("regularization for overfitting...)
- ::solution ("L1 regularization for overfitting")
- ::object ("penalty term")

**If you have a Job / Training focus**


1. Taylor the problem types to what you exoect to encounter at your job.

2. focus on what might take you too much time to hunt for solutions in real-time. 

3. be sure examples are well annotated 

4. include references to relevant functions in associated libraries

5. Flow: problem type -> problem -> solution under assumptions -> examples

I hope these are helpful
